Requirements satisfied:
1. Fully functional responsive menubars and containers compatible with all devices and browsers
2. Subtle use of animations wherever required to improve User Experience
3. Javascript features such as Carousel, Collapsible, Navbar, Dropdown, Grid, Fade-in, Smooth Anchor Scroll and Forms
4. Served justice by using colors, dimensions and distances that go in sync with the page irrespective of device size
5. Carefully handpicked icons and images to add quality content without affecting page speed

My Approach for development
1. Did Component based development with Angular for code resusability
2. Did not go mobile-first, since designs had to be thought out for smaller devices
3. Consistently checked compatibility with Mobile, Web, Tablet, Large screen and other browsers
4. Used Materialize CSS for Transitions, Javascript plugins and functionalities
5. Used Adobe Photoshop for image picking and styles recognition
6. Got inspired from awwwards.com ranked websites for transitions and responsiveness
